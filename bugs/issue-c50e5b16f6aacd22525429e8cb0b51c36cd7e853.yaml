title: maildir expects new messages to have higher mtime
desc: |-
  When saving new messages to a maildir source using mutt, the message
  mtime is not updated to the time the message was copied to the maildir.
  This makes sup fail to detect new messages on the maildir.
  
  This also makes sup vulnerable to problems if the mtime of the files
  on the maildir changes. Using just the filenames to identify the messages
  on maildir sources would be safer.
